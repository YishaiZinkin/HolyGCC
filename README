This plugin enables HolyC prints in standard C.

HolyC is a programming language based on C that was used for writing TempleOS.
It was created by Terry A. Davis.

One of HolyC's features is printing without the need to write printf
boilerplates. For example, instead of writing

    printf ("Hello world\n");

in HolyC (and with this plugin) you can write just

    "Hello world\n";


Notes:

 - This plugin doesn't inhibit -Wunused-value, so if this flag is set HolyC
   prints actually trigger warnings.

 - The plugin doesn't support formatted strings in HolyC prints.

 - HolyC prints are supported in C only.

 - HolyC prints are not supported inside nested functions.
